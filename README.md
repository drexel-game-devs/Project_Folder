# Project_Folder

So this is the General Project Folder.
This will contain all assets, art, code, etc. 

Please make sure to put relevant files inside their relevant folders (i.e art goes in Art folder, code in Code etc.)
Also, try to make sure to create new folders within folders so we know what we're looking at:
  -If you're making art for a level create a folder within the art folder called : Level01_Platform_Art as an example.
